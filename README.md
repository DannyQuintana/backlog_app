# Backlog App

This is a simple application developed following a tutorial from Web Dev Simplified.

Currently, the app allows users to add items to a list with basic features to
check tasks as complete, delete tasks, and save tasks to local storage. I plan to
take these basic features and build upon them to create a video game backlog tracker.

## Current Features

- Add games to your backlog: Easily add retro games to your backlog list.
- Mark games as complete: Once you finish playing a game, mark it as complete to keep track of your progress.
- Delete games: Remove games from the app when you no longer want to track them.

## TODO

- Add Currently Playing Status: Mark games that are currently being played.
- Add Pause Status: Mark games as "Paused"; this will move them to a separate list.
- Add a Review Functionality: Incorporate a review feature where you can rate the game and give a brief overview of your playing experience.
- Add basic filtering features: Enable filtering games by genre, platform, year of release, etc.
- Add basic stats screen: Show completed games based on certain dates, genre, platform, etc.
